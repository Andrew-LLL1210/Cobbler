# Cobbler
A Minecraft quality-of-life datapack

## Take Control of your Inventory
With Cobbler enabled, any junk stones you mine
(granite, andesite, diorite, and dripstone)
will be converted into normal cobblestone.
Likewise, tuff will be converted into cobbled deepslate.
So the seven stone types are compressed into just two!

This behavior is disabled by default. Use
`/trigger cobbler set 1` to enable cobbler, and
`/trigger cobbler set 0` to disable.

This datapack also adds crafting recipes that simply convert each of
the stone types into cobblestone (or cobbled deepslate for tuff)
